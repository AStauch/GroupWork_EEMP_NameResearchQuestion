### Examination format
### Group work:

### - At the end of the second week of the semester, you will be assigned to a group. We will randomly allocate students to groups during the course.

### - In the group, you will analyze a data set of your own choice and apply the methods learned in class. This assignment is designed to help students apply the skills learned in the course to a practical application of their choice.

### - The groups will give short presentations of their work (about 12 minutes per group + 10 minutes of discussion) on November 18-19 during the scheduled lecture slots. Groups must hand in their slides and a Juypter Notebook with their analysis code, explanation, and interpretation by November 18 at noon. Each group will be assigned to a time slot to present without the presence of the other groups.
