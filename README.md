# GroupWork_EEMP_NameResearchQuestion
This is a group work project in the course "The empirical evaluation of management practices".
It aims to apply the concepts and methods learned in class to a data set of our choice.

The question we try to answer is: the predictive power of education on GDP (GDP ~ education).

Our null-hypothesis is: education has no association with/ impact on GDP.

Alternative hypothisis: education has an association with/ impact on GDP.
